MTM Buddy is an accompanying tool for Microsoft Test Manager which provides additional functionalities around reporting.

 MTM Buddy collates the MTM data (test results, tester name etc.) and VSTF data (priority, automation status etc.) and generates reports on top of this data. 
 
MTM Buddy gives you the ability to 
* Generate standard reports like priority distribution, automation ratios etc. with roll up for a suite and all of its children. 
* Query based on result, priority, tester name etc. 
* Carry out bulk operations like assigning cases across multiple suites. 
* Bulk update results across multiple suite. 
* Create Visual Studio playlists for cases based on priority, result etc
